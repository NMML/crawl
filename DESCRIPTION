Description: The (C)orrelated (RA)ndom (W)alk (L)ibrary of
    R functions was designed for fitting continuous-time
    correlated random walk (CTCRW) models with time indexed
    covariates. The model is fit using the Kalman-Filter on
    a state space version of the continuous-time stochastic
    movement process.
