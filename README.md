Correlated RAndom Walk Library of R functions
---------------------------------------------

The Correlated RAndom Walk Library of R functions was designed for fitting continuous-time correlated random walk (CTCRW) models with time indexed covariates. The model is fit using the Kalman-Filter on a state space version of the continuous-time stochastic movement process.
