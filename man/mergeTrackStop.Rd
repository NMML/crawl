\title{Merge a location data set with a dry time (or other stopping) covariate}
\usage{
mergeTrackStop(data, stopData, Time.name = "Time", interp = c("zeros",
  "ma0"), win = 2, constCol)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Location data.}

\item{stopData}{stopping variable data set.}

\item{Time.name}{character naming time index variable in both data sets}

\item{interp}{method of interpolation.}

\item{win}{window for "ma0" interpolation method.}

\item{constCol}{columns in \code{data} for which the user would like to be
constant, such as id or sex.}
}
\value{
Merged data.frame with new column from \code{stopData}. Missing values in
the stopping variable will be interpolated
}
\description{
The function merges a location data set with a stopping variable data set.
}
\details{
Simply merges the data frames and interpolates based on the chosen method.
Both data frames have to use the same name for the time variable. Also
contains \code{stopType} which = "o" if observed or "p" for interpolated.

The merged data is truncated to the first and last time in the location data
set. Missing values in the stopping variable data set can be interpolated by
replacing them with zeros (full movement) or first replacing with zeros then
using a moving average to smooth the data. Only the missing values are then
replace with this smoothed data. This allows a smooth transition to full
movement.

\examples{


track <- data.frame(TimeVar=sort(runif(20,0,20)), x=1:20, y=20:1)
track
stopData <- data.frame(TimeVar=0:29, stopVar=round(runif(30)))
stopData
mergeTrackStop(track, stopData, Time.name="TimeVar")
