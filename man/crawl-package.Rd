\title{Fit Continuous-Time Correlated Random Walk Models to Animal Movement Data}
\description{
The Correlated RAndom Walk Library (I know it is not an R library,
but, "crawp" did not sound as good) of R functions was designed for fitting
continuous-time correlated random walk (CTCRW) models with time indexed
covariates. The model is fit using the Kalman-Filter on a state space
version of the continuous-time staochistic movement process.
